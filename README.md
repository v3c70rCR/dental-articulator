# Design of Dental Articulators for Educational Material in the Faculty of Dentistry


## Introduction
In collaboration with the Faculty of Dentistry, a project was developed to design dental articulators based on old examples with the objective of providing educational material for student practice.

## Methodology

1. **3D Scanning:**
   - The academics from the Faculty of Dentistry provided a 3D scan of a complete jaw with teeth and gums. This scan served as the starting point for the design process.
   
2. **Model Processing:**
   - Using the software Meshmixer, the teeth were removed from the scan, leaving only the gums. This process allowed the creation of a suitable base for the new articulator design.
   
3. **Design in Fusion 360:**
   - The processed gums were imported into Fusion 360, where the new dental articulator was designed. The design was based on the proportions of the old articulator model, which served as a guide.
   - The new articulator was designed to be articulated and to allow horizontal movement of the jaw, thus simulating different mandibular morphologies according to individual patient needs.

4. **3D Printing:**
   - The final design was exported and prepared for printing using the Cura software.
   - The material chosen for printing was PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) due to its characteristics of strength, durability, and flexibility. PETG is known for its excellent impact resistance, thermal stability, and mechanical properties, making it ideal for applications that require high durability and precision.
   - Bolts were used for the articulator's joints, ensuring robust and precise functionality.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Precise Removal of Teeth:**
   - The process of removing the teeth from the scan without affecting the gums was challenging. By using the advanced editing tools in Meshmixer, careful and precise handling of the model was achieved.
   
- **Articulated Design:**
   - Creating a design that allowed the simulation of different mandibular morphologies required detailed planning and several adjustments in Fusion 360, achieving a result that met both functional and educational expectations.

## Results
The project resulted in the production of a functional and durable dental articulator suitable for use in dental practices. The designed articulators provide a valuable tool for student training, allowing them to experiment with various conditions and mandibular issues in a controlled environment.

## Conclusion
This project not only met the initial requirements of providing educational material but also demonstrated the effectiveness of modern technologies such as 3D scanning and 3D printing in creating advanced educational tools. The interdisciplinary collaboration between the FabLab and the Faculty of Dentistry has opened new possibilities for future projects and developments.
